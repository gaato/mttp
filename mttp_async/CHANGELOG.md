# Changelog

All notable changes to `gaato/http-async` are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). While the version is
0.x, a minor release (0.x → 0.y) may contain breaking changes; a patch release
never does.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Depends on gaato/mttp, which now holds the vocabulary formerly in gaato/http.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-11-10

### Added

- HTTP/1 listener with bounded admission, graceful shutdown and tracked
  background work; host-neutral streaming fetch handlers and JavaScript host
  shims, including Lambda's absent-body fix; serve and fetch examples.

### Changed

- The module moves from [gaato/mbt-sdk](https://github.com/gaato/mbt-sdk) to
  [gaato/mttp](https://github.com/gaato/mttp) and is rebuilt; no 0.5 API
  carries over.
